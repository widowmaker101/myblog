## The Road That Changed Me

It started with a **single step** in **Cotonou, Benin** — the air thick with **fish smoke and motorbike exhaust**.

I crossed into **Togo** on a **tro-tro** packed with **laughing grandmothers**, their **headscarves bright as sunflowers**.

In **Ghana**, I walked the **Cape Coast Castle dungeons** — the **ocean roared outside**, but inside, only **silence and ghosts**.

Then came the **big leap**: a **red-eye flight** from **Abidjan to Addis Ababa**. I watched the **Sahara glow orange** from 30,000 feet.

Finally, **Cape Town** — **Table Mountain rising like a god**, the **Atlantic crashing below**.

**10,687 km. 6 countries. 1 heart forever altered.**
