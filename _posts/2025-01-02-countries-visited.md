## 6 Countries, 6 Unforgettable Humans

1. **Benin Republic**  
   **Mama Afi** taught me **voodoo is love**, not fear. She danced at midnight under **full moon**.

2. **Togo**  
   **Kofi**, a fisherman, shared **palm wine** and said: *"The sea gives, the sea takes."*

3. **Ghana**  
   **Auntie Akosua** fed me **fufu and light soup** — said I was **"now Ghanaian by stomach"**.

4. **Ivory Coast**  
   **DJ Serge** played **coupé-décalé** till dawn. **Abidjan never sleeps.**

5. **Ethiopia**  
   **Priest Dawit** let me enter **Lalibela's rock churches** at sunrise. **Angels were singing.**
