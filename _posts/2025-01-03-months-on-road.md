## The Emotional Timeline

- **January**: **Benin** — *First border crossing. Heart racing. Am I ready?*
- **February**: **Togo** — *Laughter in markets. First real connection.*
- **March**: **Ghana** — *Tears at Cape Coast. History hurts.*
- **May**: **Ivory Coast** — *Danced till 4 AM. Felt alive.*
- **August**: **Ethiopia** — *Silence in Lalibela. Spiritual reset.*
- **October**: **Cape Town** — *Stood on Table Mountain. Cried. Home.*

**10 months. 300+ days. Countless versions of me.**
